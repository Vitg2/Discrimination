## Demography

function **demos** create dataframe with two subpopulations - "northern" and "southern". 

Variables = by default

N0 = 500 - population of Northern

N1 = 500 - population of Southern

B0 = 0.2 - proportion of bad borrowers Northern

B1 = 0.7 - proportion of bad borrowers Southern

m0g = 70 - average rating of good Northern 

d0g = 10 - standard deviation of good Northern

m0b = 50 - average rating of bad Northern

d0b = 10 - standard deviation of bad Northern

m1g = 70 - average rating of good Southern

d1g = 10 - standard deviation of good Southern

m1b = 50 - average rating of bad Southern

d1b = 10 - standard deviation of bad Southern
